/**
 * Test Objective:
 * Verify behavior when RADIUS returns a VLAN ID that is not defined on a
 * controller in the network.  Consider the user at home and egress the clients
 * traffic locally from the MAP using the VLAN ID returned by RADIUS.
 * Steps:
 * 1.	Configure a client profile of vlanuser99 in RADIUS that returns VLAN ID of
 * 99
 * 2.	Make sure that VLAN 99 is not defined as a network profile or an interface
 * on the controller.
 * 3.	Associate vlanuser99 to msm10-1.
 * 4.	Traffic is egressed locally at the MAP using VLAN 99.
 * Pass/Fail criteria:
 * 1.	Message must be logged that an unknown VLAN was returned
 * 2.	Traffic must be egressed locally from MAP using VLAN 99.
 * 
 * Test results interpretation: Major
